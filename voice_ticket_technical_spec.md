- **Backend**: Node.js/Python microservices, Docker containers, Kubernetes
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (caching), Elasticsearch (search)
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **API Gateway**: Kong or AWS API Gateway
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS/GCP/Azure multi-cloud deployment

## 2. Client Layer Architecture

### 2.1 Voice Processing Pipeline

#### Wake Word Detection
```
Input: Continuous audio stream
Process: Local ML model (lightweight CNN)
Trigger: "Hey BookIt" / "Book Ticket" / Tap gesture
Output: Activation signal to main processing
```

#### Speech-to-Text Processing
```
Primary Path: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
- Streaming recognition with interim results
- Multi-language support (EN, HI, TA, TE, GU)
- Confidence scoring and error recovery

Fallback Path: Vosk Offline STT
- Local model inference
- Network-independent operation
- Reduced accuracy but maintained functionality
```

#### Natural Language Understanding Flow
```
1. Audio Input → STT Engine
2. Text Output → Language Detection
3. Detected Language → NLU Service
4. Intent + Entities → Booking Orchestrator
5. Business Logic → Response Generation
6. Response → TTS → Audio Output
```

### 2.2 UI State Management

#### Voice Interaction States
1. **Idle State**: Passive listening for wake word
2. **Active Listening**: Recording user command with visual feedback
3. **Processing**: "Thinking" indicator while processing request
4. **Confirmation**: Displaying booking details for voice confirmation
5. **Payment**: UPI voice payment flow
6. **Completion**: Ticket generation and QR code display
7. **Error Recovery**: Voice-guided error correction

#### Visual Elements
- **Central Microphone**: Animated based on audio levels
- **Soundwave Visualization**: Real-time audio feedback
- **Status Indicators**: Connection, processing, confirmation states
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, large touch targets, voice descriptions
